Yet another theme for Redmine .. only changing some colours to make it less "intrusive"

The general idea is to get a GitHub feeling with as a small as possible stylesheet
(making it easy to change, should there be breaking changes from Redmine)

Just download/clone into folder redmine/public/themes. 
Use it by means of Administration > Settings > Display > Themes

Replace the ico.png in the images folder to something you prefer
(or change in the stylesheet to get the default Redmine one)
